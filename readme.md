This is a repo for some short stories and other creative writing that I am working on.  I am intending on tracking changes with Git to keep a decent record of the process of editing and (hopefully) improvement. I can't see a huge value in anyone forking them but go wild if you want.  Please feel free to leave comments and suggestions.

All of the stories are (C) Mark Johnson.
